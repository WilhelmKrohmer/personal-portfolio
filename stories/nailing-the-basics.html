                <p class="body-1-long">
                    With increasing complexity of mobile apps, having a simple 
                    navigation has never been more important. Nevertheless
                    looking through App and Play Store you&#39;ll find a lot of 
                    apps with overly complex navigation, hidden menus
                    and counterintuitive architecture.
                </p>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    When cellular provider otelo relaunched their iOS and Android 
                    apps in 2016, one of their main promises to users was a simple 
                    navigation. &quot;Everything you need on just two screens&quot; 
                    was what they claimed. What may have been an award-winning navigation 
                    then, sadly is outdated today. As lead app designer I was tasked to join the otelo team to help them reach 
                    their starting goal for 2020: improving their navigation.

                    Well, it&#39;s just a standard navigation, isn&#39;t it? 
                    â€” Yes, it is! ðŸ™‚ Standards are what enables users to
                    find their way with ease. Plus they enable us designers 
                    to focus on innovating in new areas. In otelo&#39;s case
                    they also solved a lot of issues.

                </picture>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    As opposed to otelos original claim â€“â€“ &quot;Everything you 
                    need on just two screens&quot; â€“â€“ there are actually
                    five main areas of the app:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="body-1-short">Account details</li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">The tariff status</li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">Notifications and messages</li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">Tariff details with additional options</li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">Digital services</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Each one of them was located in a different area of the screen. Additionally they were represented by different
                    UI elements: Swipeable text tabs, an avatar picture, a mail icon and a big orange floating action button on the
                    bottom right.
                </p>
                <p class="body-1-long">There were several problems with that:</p>
                <h4 class="display-4 headline-divider">Scattered navigation</h4>
                <p class="body-1-long">You really have to make the effort to discover what areas there are.</p>
                <h4 class="display-4 headline-divider">Cluttered screen</h4>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    There are different elements everywhere. Even though status and tariff are the most important areas, their design
                    is very subtle. On the other hand the other three areas are very dominant. Especially the orange floating action
                    button takes away focus and looks like the primary action of the screen, even though it&#39;s not.
                </p>
                <h4 class="display-4 headline-divider">Unclear interactions</h4>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Status and tariff look like they are just text elements. While subtle design is good, for inexperienced users
                    they may not even seem clickable. Also a lot of people don&#39;t know tabs can often be navigated by swiping.
                </p>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    The orange button is just labeled with a question mark. It may be unclear what the button would do when tapped.
                    Will it open tutorials or an FAQ? Maybe a contact form or chat?
                </p>
                <h4 class="display-4 headline-divider">Growing mobile device sizes</h4>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Four of five elements are positioned almost at the top of the screen. On big mobile devices they are really hard
                    to reach.
                </p>
                <h4 class="display-4 headline-divider">No text labels for icons</h4>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Icons are awesome to have because they help to understand the UI no matter what language a person speaks.
                    Nevertheless using icons without accompanying text, or in this case, an avatar or a question mark, is not enough
                    to explain what lies behind those elements. Text labels are extremely helpful for understanding the meaning
                    behind icons.
                </p>
                <h4 class="display-4 headline-divider">Misused modality</h4>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Account, messages and services are all opened in fullscreen modal views, which should only be used for
                    self-contained tasks with a fixed start and end and require an explicit action to exit. Using modal views here
                    could lead to using up a lot of device memory, because the background task is being kept active. Also it makes
                    navigation much harder. People might mistakingly close the whole modal and return to the start screen instead of
                    just going back one screen at a time.

                    A consistent navigation at the bottom of the screen! Placing all main areas near to each other as a fixed bar at
                    the bottom fixed all the previous issues:

                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        Every main area is represented consistently by an icon and text label, improving the discoverability of all

                        Having all areas in one place cleans up the screen, making it look more polished and easy to scan

                        All areas are easily reachable on every device no matter the device size or if right or left-handed

                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        Having a navigation at the bottom is a standard nowadays. People are used to it and will easily find their
                        way!
                    </li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        iOS and Android natively support this kind of navigation, known as a tab bar on iOS and bottom navigation on
                        Android. This makes implementation easier and helps with backwards-compatibility
                    </li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        All areas will be opened in a &quot;normal&quot; way (no modals any more). This makes the correct use of
                        modals possible: All areas where data can be edited were implemented as a modal view.

                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Nailing the basics with mobile navigation might seem like an easy task. Just put the menu at the bottom, right?
                    Not so fast â€” changing the main navigation of an existing app almost always goes with changing the whole app
                    architecture. Most likely developers will dig up some good ol&#39; outdated code and have to clean up a lot of
                    mess from 100 years past. When doing that, designers have to confront numerous side effects that will unerringly
                    pop up.
                </p>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Yet it was really worth it! Having improved navigation, otelo was ready to tackle their next big projects,
                    confident that users would find everything and be able to complete all their tasks. For me personally this
                    project taught me to appreciate the thought that went into creating these components that have earned their
                    right to be a standard nowadays! And by using them, we can focus on innovating in new areas without any
                    established standards.
