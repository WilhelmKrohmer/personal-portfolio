                <p class="body-1-long">
                    In e-commerce there are many different 
                    <a class="link" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ecommerce-shoppers/" target="blank">
                        kinds of shoppers,</a>
                    each with their unique traits and needs. Sometimes people like 
                    to browse and get inspired, sometimes they do a lot of research and 
                    sometimes they know exactly what they want. For those product-focused 
                    shoppers, finding their desired product as fast as possible is crucial 
                    to their experience.

                    While there are a lot of aspects that help customers achieve this goal, 
                    two of the most important ones are an efficient search and clear product 
                    categories. Both help with different needs: search allows finding a 
                    specific item, while categories help customers narrow down all available 
                    products to a manageable list. Making both elements as simple and easy as 
                    can be is key to helping them reach their goal.

                    With the redesigned product catalogue you can reach a narrowed-down 
                    product list with just two clicks. Swipeable tabs and collapsible 
                    accordeons make for easy switching between categories, without leaving 
                    the screen. Icons help with quickly scanning and understanding the 
                    main categories.

                        Search results were less relevant, because they showed 
                        articles across all categories. People searching for women 
                        clothing would also find men and kids clothing

                        searched for their text value instead of opening the category. 
                        This led to less specific search results. For example searching 
                        for &quot;trousers&quot; and then clicking on the corresponding 
                        category would open a product list with not only trousers, but all

                        It was hard to switch between categories, because opening a

                        to go back and forth to do this.

                        without actually seeing any products at all and without being able 
                        to evaluate if it was the correct category. Also a lot of sub-categories 
                        had confusing names that just weren&#39;t understandable.

                        Opening those very specific categories would sometimes lead to product 
                        lists with only two or three products. This means product lists often were 
                        a dead end for customers and they had to go back again.

                    user control over what they want to search. For categories this 
                    decreases interaction cost, because customers don&#39;t have to 
                    open and close those categories anymore. They just tap them or

                    up the process for the majority. Depending on the chosen main

                    Displaying categories as accordeons makes checking sub-categories 
                    really fast. We refrained from closing all other categories, when 
                    one is clicked, even though this is a typical behaviour. This comes 
                    with two benefits:

                    <li class="body-1-short">It prevents a typical problem with mobile accordeons: When opening regular accordeons, the content height could shrink a lot, because another accordeon with a lot of height would be closed simultaneously. This often results in the selected accordeon moving out of the viewport. </li>

                <p class="body-1-long">
                    We also added icons to each top-level category for quick scanning 
                    and to improve language-barriers. Each sub-category will now lead 
                    to a product list, so no endless sub-categories anymore. Also the 
                    whole cell is clickable now.
