                    As I described in the
                    <a class="link" href="finding-the-right-product-fast-1.html">first part</a> of my series, reducing friction for
                    product-focused shoppers is key to helping them reach their goal.
                    In my first case study I focused on categories and search as a
                    crucial part of that experience. The journey doesn&#39;t stop there
                    however. When people successfully find a correct category or search
                    for a specific item, they will encounter one of the most complex page
                    types to design: a (product) list.

                    On the new product list you can see the most important
                    information at a glance: basic info such as image, title,
                    price and colors, but also key product characteristics, like
                    material. Quickfilters and clear access to sorting and filters
                    help with narrowing down the list.

                <p class="body-1-long">All lists share some basic common characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        They present a specific amount of items to the user
                    </li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        Each item is accompanied by information to help identify
                        the correct one (those currently searched by the user)
                    </li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        Each item will often lead to a detail page, showing more
                        specific information about it
                    </li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        Based on the characteristics of each item, there will probably
                        be at least some basic functionality to narrow down or sort the
                        list
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Designing those lists is one of the most complex parts of any project.
                    List visitors have to decide which item they should give their attention
                    to and which items to ignore. It&#39;s all about the right balance: Give
                    people too little or the wrong information and they have to navigate back
                    and forth between list and various detail pages to determine the correct
                    item, thus increasing <a class="link"
                    href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/">interaction cost</a>.
                    Give them too much information and they will be overwhelmed by a cluttered
                    screen and will have difficulty reviewing each item, being hindered by
                    a high <a class="link" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/">cognitive load</a>.

                <p class="body-1-long">
                    In e-commerce, when scanning a product list, shoppers will quickly check out
                    the first products and decide if what they see is relevant to them. If it is
                    not, they will see what configuration options they might have to narrow down
                    the list. Patience is low, especially in mobile apps, since the screen size is
                    small and not a lot of products are visible at the same time. It&#39;s neither
                    possible to open multiple tabs like in a browser, so the ability to compare
                    multiple products is limited.

                    The previous product list was okay. It had the most important
                    elements:

                <ul>

                    It was also very clean, so users would not get overwhelmed
                    by too much information. Still, there are a lot of problems
                    that needed solving:

                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        Images show models in an inconsistent way, which made
                        comparability and sometimes even
                        recognizing the product hard
                    </li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        Product titles were very short and did not contain helpful information

                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        The wishlist icon was just an outline on the product image. On some images it was hardly
                        recognizable, due to it overlapping with the product
                    </li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        Colors were overlapping, so it was hard to recognize what colors were available

                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        The amount of products in a list was not displayed, so people had no quantitative indication if
                        it would make sense to filter the list

                    <li class="body-1-short">
                        The filter was displayed as an icon only. While the icon complied with conventions, adding a

                        There was no indication on how the list was sorted. Sorting was hidden in filters, even though
                        it is actually a different kind of configuration (changing order as opposed to reducing
                        quantity)

                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Improving all problems mentioned above would be a good step in the right direction. But when working
                    on this project, we realized that we had to answer another key question:</p>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    Is there enough information to help customers with deciding which product to look
                    at?
                </p>
                <p class="body-1-long">
                    We found out that s.Oliver had a lot of additional product information. This information was already
                    being used on product detail pages. But before deciding on what information to display, we had to
                    figure out what was actually important to our customers.

                    <li class="body-1-short">We separated filters from sorting, to make a clear distinction between those two configurations.

                    <li class="body-1-short">Filters and sorting are now placed in a sticky bar that will hide when scrolling down and come
                        out again when scrolling up. This way the bar can be accessed more easily than the old filter

                    <li class="body-1-short">Under filters we display additional product subcategories which help people with quickly
                        narrowing down the list, if they look for a more specific type of clothing</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="display-4">The products</h2>
                <p class="body-1-long">Before we started working on the product tiles, we had to decide on the importance of various types
                    of information. We did this by conducting an e-mail survey using the s.Oliver newsletter. Since
                    there was no user research done at s.Oliver before that, this was the perfect option to kickstart
                    this. It was also a good method to reach our target audience while keeping it low-budget and
                    uncomplicated. And it worked! With over 10.000 participants the result was more than satisfying. 🙂

                </picture>
                <p class="body-1-long">Here are our top 3 candidates:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="body-1-short">Price reductions</li>
                    <li class="body-1-short">Additional promotions</li>

                </ol>
                <p class="body-1-long">We had a lot of additional product characteristics, but they were all regarded as unimportant by our
                    customers. We could pretty much use all the insights from our survey to prioritize information on
                    the product tiles. We just made one important exception:
                </p>
                <p class="body-1-long">In our survey customers regarded additional size options as unimportant. Nevertheless we decided to
                    display them with a higher priority than material. Why is that? Well, if you shop at s.Oliver and
                    need those sizes, the product list would be useless for you without that information. Even though
                    this might not be important to everyone, we decided that it would have too high a negative impact on
                    those people. So our final top priorities were:

                        it will be directly related to the product. The badge contains either information about
                        promotions, additional sizes or material. Which of those information is being displayed was
                        defined according to our guidelines.</li>

                <h1 class="display-3">Lessons learned</h1>
                <p class="body-1-long">With the new product list, we found a way to increase usability and product relevance for our
                    customers. It was exciting to find out about what really matters to them through our research. It
                    not only helped with prioritizing information from the customer&#39;s perspective, but also with
                    balancing out marketing requirements and user needs.</p>
                <p class="body-1-long">I learned that a product list is never finished. It needs to adapt to their user&#39;s needs and
                    preferences, which can change with time. We managed to design a good generic list, but a lot of
                    various topics still remained untouched. In my mind the perfect list would change, based on a
                    specific person&#39;s situation and desires. It could show different information, based on where a
                    person came from, what filter&#39;s they chose or what personal preferences they have.</p>
                <p class="body-1-long">Finding the right balance of how much and which information to display is really hard to accomplish.
                    It&#39;s vital to continue improving a list by learning all you can about the people who use it and
                    the situations their using it in.</p>
